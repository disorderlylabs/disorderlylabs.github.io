						<div class="panel-body">
							Large-scale distributed systems must be built to anticipate and mitigate a variety of hardware and software failures. In
							order to build confidence that fault-tolerant systems are correctly implemented, Netflix (and similar enterprises)
							regularly run failure drills in which faults are deliberately injected in their production system. The combinatorial
							space of failure scenarios is too large to explore exhaustively. Existing failure testing approaches either randomly
							explore the space of potential failures randomly or exploit the “hunches” of domain experts to guide the search. Random
							strategies waste resources testing “uninteresting” faults, while programmer-guided approaches are only as good as
							human intuition and only scale with human effort. In this paper, we describe how we adapted and implemented a research
							prototype called lineage-driven fault injection (LDFI) to automate failure testing at Netflix. Along the way, we describe
							the challenges that arose adapting the LDFI model to the complex and dynamic realities of the Netflix architecture.
							We show how we implemented the adapted algorithm as a service atop the existing tracing and fault injection infrastructure,
							and present early results.

						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">
							Failure is always an option; in large-scale data management systems, it is practically a certainty. Fault-tolerant protocols
							and components are notoriously difficult to implement and debug. Worse still, choosing existing fault-tolerance mechanisms
							and integrating them correctly into complex systems remains an art form, and programmers have few tools to assist
							them. We propose a novel approach for discovering bugs in fault-tolerant data management systems: lineage-driven fault
							injection. A lineage-driven fault injector reasons backwards from correct system outcomes to determine whether failures
							in the execution could have prevented the outcome. We present MOLLY, a prototype of lineage-driven fault injection
							that exploits a novel combination of data lineage techniques from the database literature and state-of-the-art satisfiability
							testing. If fault-tolerance bugs exist for a particular configuration, MOLLY finds them rapidly, in many cases using
							an order of magnitude fewer executions than random fault injection. Otherwise, MOLLY certifies that the code is bug-free
							for that configuration.
